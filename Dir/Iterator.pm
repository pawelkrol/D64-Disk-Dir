=head1 NAME

D64::Disk::Dir::Iterator - Iterating through Commodore (D64/D71/D81) disk image directory entries

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use D64::Disk::Dir::Iterator;

  # Create an iterator with a directory object instance:
  my $iter = D64::Disk::Dir::Iterator->new($d64DiskDirObj);

  # Perlish style iterator:
  while (my $entry = $iter->getNext()) {
    # ...do something with $entry...
  }

  # C++-ish style iterator:
  for (my $iter = D64::Disk::Dir::Iterator->new($d64DiskDirObj); $iter->hasNext(); $iter->next()) {
    my $entry = $iter->current();
    # ...do something with $entry...
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package provides an iterative method of accessing individual directory entries available within D64::Disk::Dir object instance based on a simple class for iterating over Perl arrays. See the description of L<Array::Iterator> package for a complete list of available methods and iteration process examples.

=head2 new

Create an iterator with a D64::Disk::Dir object instance:

  my $iter = D64::Disk::Dir::Iterator->new($d64DiskDirObj);

=cut

sub new {
    my $this = shift;
    my $d64DiskDirObj = shift;
    croak "Not a D64::Disk::Dir object: \"$d64DiskDirObj\"" unless defined $d64DiskDirObj and $d64DiskDirObj->can("_get_dir_entries");
    my $entries = $d64DiskDirObj->_get_dir_entries();
    my $class = ref($this) || $this;
    my $self = $class->SUPER::new($entries);
    bless $self, $class;
    return $self;
}
